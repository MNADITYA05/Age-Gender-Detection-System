Face Recognition and Age, Gender Detection System.

This project implements a real-time face recognition system capable of detecting faces in images and video streams using OpenCV and the YOLOv5 model. It extends the functionality by integrating age and gender classification for recognized faces, enhancing the utility of the system in various applications.

Features:

* Face Detection: Utilizes the YOLOv5 model through OpenCV to detect faces in real-time from webcam feeds or static images.

* Age and Gender Classification: Once a face is detected, the system estimates the age group and gender of the individual using advanced image processing techniques.

* Multiple Faces Handling: Prioritizes the largest face in case of multiple detections to ensure accurate recognition and classification.

* Reference Image Matching: Allows recognition against pre-defined reference images, enabling personalized identification and labeling.

* User Interface: Provides a simple yet effective UI displaying recognized faces with their identified name (if available), age group, and gender.
